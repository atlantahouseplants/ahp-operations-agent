They have about 20 plants across their two-floor office in Midtown — mix of pothos, snake plants, ZZ plants, and a few dracaenas. Plants were a bit neglected by previous provider but nothing that can't be recovered in a few weeks. Met office manager Lisa Chen. She wants recap emails after every visit. Took stock photos of all plant locations for our records.",
