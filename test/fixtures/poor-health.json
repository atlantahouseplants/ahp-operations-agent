    "Service Notes & Details": "This account is in bad shape. Spider mites found on fiddle leaf figs on the 4th floor — webbing visible on most leaves. Standing water under the conference room planters from a broken drainage insert — root rot starting on the pothos. Bacterial leaf spot spreading on the aglaonema in reception. Applied systemic insecticide. Removed worst infected material. The drainage issue needs to be fixed within the week or we'll lose the conference room plants entirely.",
