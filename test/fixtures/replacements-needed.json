    "List Replacements Needed": "6 inch pothos in the lobby reception desk is completely dead — soil bone dry and stems gone mushy. 10 inch bird of paradise in the main conference room has broken its main stem — too damaged to recover, needs a full replacement. 4 inch ZZ plant on the windowsill in office 214 has yellowed out entirely. About 3 of the small succulent arrangements near the elevator lobby need refreshing — dried out past saving.",
