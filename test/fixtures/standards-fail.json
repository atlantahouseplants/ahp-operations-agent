    "Service Notes & Details": "Several lobby plants are not at AHP presentation standards. The peace lilies near check-in have brown tips from the AC vent directly above. The containers in the conference wing are visibly salt-stained. The facilities team moved two large dracaenas into a dark corner without telling us — they need to go back. Overall plant health is OK but the visual presentation is below what we should be delivering for a hotel property.",
